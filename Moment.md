There are moments in my life which is more memorable than the others. I'd like to list them here.

1. **2008 Financial Crisis**, I was at the China Life Plaza at central Beijing and the company TV was set at Phoenix Channel. It was a lunch break so the volume was unmuted. I stood in front of the TV, hearing all those words Credit Swaps, MBS etc, having no idea what the hell they were talking about. Never felt more like a moron in my life.
2. **Mankiw's Macroeconomics**, before going to Singapore, I thought that knowledge has to be passed through by the teachers. Yet when I read Mankiw's books, I have this confidence that I have it. It was the first time I experienced that confidence, and it came many times in the later days.
3. **Addicted to Gaming**, it is a rather perculiar feeling, like time does not exist. I literaly sit there unmoved for over 10hs. Amazing. At least I know that I have that level of focus and concentration, now it is just a matter of how to tap into it.
4. **Calmness after Cans of Beers**, my default mental state seems to be anxiety ridden. Yet, after cans of beers I can experience a calmness that is foreign to me. Should figure out a way to access that state without beers.
