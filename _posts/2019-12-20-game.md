There is a circuit in my brain that would make me addictive to gaming. The past few days I was hooked by a number's game to win coupon for Astrill.

Few take aways:
> 1. I notice how fast time flys by when I am hooked. As if time does not exit, I wake up and have no idea where it went. It would be great if coding of other activities that I actually suppose to do feels that way.
> 2. How to analyse the strategy for a game? One idea I come up with is to decompose. For instance, this game have two components to it, one is the location of the tile and second is the randomness of the number appeared, between 2, 4, 8 in ascending frequency. To analyse it, I can first take away the randomness, assume all 2s, and fome up with a strategy for it. Only later I would add randomness.
> 3. attention. once the patten get screwed up, it is pretty much game over. In oder to maintain the structure, one need to pay attention to axillary considerations, such as if an action would clapse the structure. It is easy when all you have to worry about is just connecting two numbers, but it is a whole ball game if you have to keep in mind more than one thing.
> 4. I had a hunch that I can play this perfectly, which turns out I was right. It took way too much time to get there, but I like the fact that I can achieve perfection right from the beginning.

My process of figuring out the game seems following these steps:

    1. there is clearly a directional aspect to the game such that the tile appears in one direction and then everyting would extract into another
    2. there could be an embedding structure to it.
    3. given the fact that there is only limited amount of tiles, the embedding tructure must be limited as well
    4.  the limit of the structure seems to be 32 or 64 such that at taht point, one have to think about collapsing things.
    5. symmetrical collapsing. the collapsing is done iteratively on both directions.

The process of figuring out a game is quite interesting, I wonder if that is something that can be programmed.

Gaming might be a good tool for training of analytical skills.
