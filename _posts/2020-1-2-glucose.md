title: Blood Glucose Monitoring
tags: [health]

I have been monitoring my blood glucose. Information about glucose that I have been gathered so far.

1. After grape or raisin, there would be a spike go over 200mg/dl. Avoid them at all cost.

2. Cortisone secretion is highest few house before waking up, which would stimulate conversion from glycogen to blood glucose. I think that cortisone spike is what is causing me waking up at around 3am regularly. While cortisone level is hard to measure, a segregate measure can be heart rate variability rate. This is a nuanced topic. High Frequency HRV seems to carry the information of vagus simulation. Need to look more into it.

From my own experiments, few conclusion can be drawn:

- fasting glucose level is at aroung 4.9mmol/l, which is the same as the one I tested 5 years ago. This seems to be a highly stable measurement. Can I lower it?

- Carbohydrate Spikes up the Glucose level and it would take a long long time to get back to the normal range. Avoid it at all cost:

- Oily Diet raise blood sugar reasonably:

- Banana raise blood sugar reasonably:

- **NUTS ARE THE BEST. SLOW RELEASE, LONG DURATION** Now it is 2pm and I still feel full, from the few nuts I consumed at 7am.
