<p> I watched an interview of Cindy Crowford and was blown away by the unexpected wisdom coming from a model</p>
<p>
She carry herself in such a way that fully took advantage of her physique yet never to the extend that you feel
she is exploiding it. She is astonishingly beautiful yet that is not all who she is. When asked about her thoughts on beauty, she said there is no denial that there is something there,  but she doesn't
 want her daughter to judge people by anything or feel that she has to deprive her self to get there.
</p>

<p>
She also shared her tips about things such as how to prevent your shirt of getting deoderant marks, and how
those 3M double sided tapes can avoid wardrabe malfunction. THen when she was asked about what she has learned
 in life, she said doing things in 80% such as work out 80% of the time, eat well 80% of the time such that
 you don't have to feel guity when you have to enjoy food or being lazy and be present
 for the things you are doing at the moment. She also said she derive her confidence from the fact that she
knows how to do her job, she can delieve what people are looking for. I know that feeling, knowing you are
 good at what you do.
