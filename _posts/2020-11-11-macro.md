What does the Money Market looks like?
![2](/assets/img/all-the-worlds-money.png)

In macroeconomy, the link between money supply and inflation was established. Why do we need inflation? Wouldn't gold standard do? Apparently, if the mandate of the federal reserve is to defend a gold peg, they can do it by letting the employment and inflation fluctuate. In the 20th century, what they discovered is that this constraints would break during crisis time such as the 1930s and the 1971 (the Nixon Shock). Someone wrote a paper looking at he 20th century history through the lens of finance, and proposed the idea that should they moved away from the gold standard at appropriate time and allowed the economy breathing room, those world wars could have been avoided.

On the one hand, a gold standard based monetary policy would exert depressionary pressure on the economy. On the other hand, too much money printing would result in hyper inflation. So the mandate of federal reserve is to target a moderate inflation rate (the newest target is aggregated 2% inflation annually) while maintain a high employment rate.

There are three tiers of monetary policy. Lowering interest rate, such that all the assets with future cashflow would have be evaluated at a higher current price, which would lend itself to higher borrowing power. All the debt can also be refinanced at a lower rate, which makes it easier to service. The second tier of monetary policy is put things onto federal reserve's balance sheet. This is a relative new style of monetary policy started since the 2008 financial crisis. Now the COVID stuff brought about the third tier monetary policy: minting new money.

In the most traditional view of financial system, banks are the only intermediary between the money printer and those who need it. However those days has long gone. Interest Rate Swaps, Credit Default Swaps and a slue of other instruments plays the role of striping away risk from a set of cash flow. Theoretically, bank is the only institutions capable of issuing credit, but that is clearly no longer the case with all sorts of shadow banking.

On a side not, why during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 covid crisis, there is no inflation risk even with all the QE and money printing? because the money printing barely made up for the decreasing in credit market.

The game of monetary policy is to maintain a balance between debt accumulation and earnings stream. The most idea situation would be the newly minted money or credit goes to activities which create a new set of cash flow, i.e. expanded the economy. However, most of the time people use the money for financial instrument purchase such as housing. The worst case scenario would be all the newly created money/credit goes into financial instrument without expanding the economy at all. That way, the price of financial assets goes up but would also set the stage for a eventual crash.

When it comes to bubble, it is actually no one's fault. When the music playing, you have no choice but to dance. That is the only rational choice. Check out this [Mervyn King interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FulCkxijZmU). In the beginning part of the interview, he reflected how even though all those people at the Bank of England can see trouble brewing in the background, they can't really do anything about it because if they raised the interest rate, and no one else does. Then given the FX mechanism for importing inflation, then that would be a losing bet. The problem with a system like this is that even though you can see the tsunami coming your way, you can't really do anything about it because the only rational choice is to keep doing that would inflame the situation. Also Perry G Mehrling's [Money View](https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking) is quite informative when it comes to understand crisis.It look at the system from a market maker's perspective.

When it comes to investment, the Ray Dalio's [all weather fund](https://youtu.be/SFaRazMpxcM?t=2847) has a interesting thinking framework behind it. In his mind there are two drivers for asset valuation increase. One is inflation, another is growth. The price is set by the expected growth and a sudden price change would result from changes in expectation. When the growth rate is greater than expected, then equity does better. When the growth rate is lesser than expected, then bond does better. A contigency table approach is used to be future proof. Sort of like there are known forces to drive the price up, structure the portforlio such that no matter which force takes the upper hand, over all, the return from this entire portfolio is the same regardless of the circumstances.

My intuition is that the entire setup is way too self-perpetuating. During the upward phase of the cycle, the most minis-cure source of income can be multiplied manifolds but the only real place to place that debt is non-productivity increasing element of the economy such as the real-estate. As a player in that system, that choice isn't really yours to make because that is actually the only rational choice at that point. The real productivity increasing activity has near zero yield. One of the common complaint during the downside of the cycle is that the line of liquidity vanished overnight. Of course they would vanish overnight, they should not have been there in the first place.WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED THIS SYSTEM TO BEGIN WITH?

Why when anything is formalized as a system, there is always an impulse to overdone it? What can be said in 10 pages just have to be said in a 1000 page book. What could have been a reasonable credit system would be magnified to the extend it is.

Here is where I come down at the economic life: there is going to be a group of people who shape the economic system into a modern one. They can win big or loose big. I am going to stay out of it. 

One thing really stunt me is that everything in financial system feeds on each other, no wonder it go through violent cycles. For instance, when the Fed cut the interest rate, banks generate more creditwhich eventually made its way into asset market, rasing the prices for financial assets. Not only that, the asset pricing scheme, which is based upon the discounted cashflow model, would raise all asset prices cross the board since the time value of money, ie. interest rate is lowered. the action of lowering interest rate manifest itself multiple times through out the system, and every component feed on one another in a possitive feedback. Who freaking comes up with this system?
