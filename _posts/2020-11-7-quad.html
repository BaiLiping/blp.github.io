<p>I first get to learn about the nemisis relationship between Nathan
Chen and Yuzura Hanyu in the 2018 winter Olympics. This two has between
at each other's throat for sometime, each pushing the boundary of what
is humanly possible. In that particular year, Nathan bombed his short
Programme because he was way too anxious. For perfect exercusion, there
is only one path, and you can't put your mind on anything other than
the performance. To make up for the short programme, Nathan performered
 an unheard of 6 quad in his long programme. This is very much the human
  limit since every quad would take gigantic engergy away from the performer.
</p>
<p>Now in 2020, I checked again on this pair. Apparently, 6 quads are the
norm now, for both of them. And each has mastered the Quad Lutz, the most complicated jump there is.
Check out Nathan's Quad Luz at the beginning of his 2019 programme. How high it.
 Look forward to seeing what this pair can do in the 2022.
