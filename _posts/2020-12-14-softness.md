1. **Get offline as often as possible.** If there is a pie chat, it would probably shown that I have spent way too much time online. 2020 is a scary year and I am really happy it is almost over now. At begining of the year, I felt that I need to get online to acquire as much information as possible, turns out, twitter can be rather addictive. It reveal parts of the societies that I never knew existed, and makes me wonder, why the hell am I still alive, how did I dodge all those bullets. At this point, I think that is prbably enough time spent on these bullshit. It is time to build myself a life as I see fit again. 
2. **Get off carbs as much as possible**. I think i just saw a study yesterday that turns out, carbs are the culprit of high blood pressure, not salt. I think at this point it is clear that carbs are no good and should be get rid off.
3. **Let's not fight the world anymore**. Yesterday, I saw a twitter war between a Caltech female prof, who is ultra progressive, with a UW tenured prof. It is just wrong, at their age, and behave that way. I kind of feel the society require us to do one thing to be a productive member of this gigantic machine, but life is much more than that. For instance, how to get your point acrossed without insult others. How to build productive relationships. I feel the softness and sensativeness of a female should be utilized instead of avoid. Maybe a better approach would be to have the capacity to hammer things ready but do everything one can to avoid it. It is just a very shitty way, to be a 40s old single female and behave the way Anima does. BE SMART, be quiet.
4. **Learn how to be a productive researcher** Intuitively, I know that a lot can be done in the field of reinforcement learning, yet the tsunami of papers that comes at you is overwhelming. Need to figure out a coping strategy.
