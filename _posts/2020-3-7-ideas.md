[1] **Human as an intricate mechanical computer**. Kinase is a group of enzyme that phosphorylation protein. With phosphorylation, protein would deform,  hence a programmable mechanical cog. On the programming side of the story, metalization of DNA controls what to transcribe. For instance, when the environment head up, certain part of the DNA is metalized and different set of protein, known as heatshock protein is transcribed to perform protective function such that other proteins would experience less deformation. **Is there a language for programming this mechanical computer**?

[2] **Relative Information**. I think information is inherently relative, this might hold the key to decision making under uncertainty.

[3] **State of Brain**. How many states brain have? Why do we change from one state to another?

[4] **RL for things that are dynamic**. Now the set up of RL assume MDP that is static. What would happen if that assumption is invalid such as trading, where the system actually changes over time.
