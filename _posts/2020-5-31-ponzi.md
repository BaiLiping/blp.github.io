How many of the works are necessary? how many are created out of a societal sanctioned ponzi scheme? Here are some of those that I can think of:

1. premature birth would most likely lead to a person who is in and out of hospitals for the rest of her/his life. 
2. How many careers are build by the same type of person to takes on the opposite sides of the choice? Cyber security experts and hackers. Thieves and policeman. It is almost like that job is created by that batch of people.
3. Extreme people who choose to be the subject or the reporter. 

Maybe one way to look at the valuation of work is whether it is eliminating this career path. Most of the jobs act to increase the entrance of that career path.
