1. Techniques for arguing for a particular logic. Suppose your logic is valid, what must have been true and how that might contradict to existing constraints. If there a hidden explanation for the observation in addition to this line of logic. Is there a premise for this logic turns out to be invalid.
2. Constraints and system. How a constraint manifest itself in a system. Sometimes it is not as straight forward as our intuition would allow us to perceive. But there might be things that we can prove, such as inequality, distribution, expected returns.
3. Looking at things from its smallest unit, a small portion of time, a small portion of control. How those small portions would manifest itself into macro parameters.
4. Bootstrap is much more important than perfection.
5. If the optimal solution is not feasible, what are the alternatives? For instance, if I can't determine the optimal choice for one step, can I study the optional solutions for a sequence of actions? This is a rather important leap for controls involve stochastidy.
