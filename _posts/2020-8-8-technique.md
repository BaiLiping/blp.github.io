If there a hidden explaination for the observation in addition to this line of logic. Is there a premise for this logic turns out to be invalid. 
2. Constraints and system. How a constraint manifest itself in a system. Sometimes it is not as straight forward as our intuition would allow us to perceive. But there might be things that we can prove, such as inequality, distribution, expected returns.
