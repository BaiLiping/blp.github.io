I just had a very interesting experience with regard to the inforamtion of flu vaccine and how the most official information can be designed to maximize gain for the society instead of oneself.

Because this year I am in an enclosed environment in campus, and the health clinic here can't get access to flu vaccine en mass so I told the class of around 50 kids that they should register for the flu vaccine if they can. One of those kids searched on Baidu, and here is what he saw:

Apparently, flu vaccine is only recommended for the very young and very old here in China, an recommendation not based on what is best for the individual since US CDC recommend this to everyone. When that kid saw this, he just send it back in a very sarcastic tone. I have to say, I was really shocked by the stupidity. After all, those kids are suppose to be reasonably smart. 

This brings me back to when Fauci was asked how didn't him recommend mask wearing sooner, he said that they had to take into consideration the lack of supply of PPE have prioritize the healthcare professionals. 

There was once I was invited to Belgium by Bayer, on the plane I talked to the person in charge of Bayer's diabetic product in China. Her main difficulty is how to get the information to people who actually need it. There are the group who readily accept the knowledge of diabetic management and there are those who just seems impervious regardless of authority or method of the information. Those are the group who lives in their own world and trust their own experience only. 

I think it is going to be very important going forward to think about what are the reasoning behind official recommendations and official information. One really need to cooborate information from multiple channels nowadays, instead of just take everything at face value. Maybe every information made available to the mass has hidden agenda. One should see through the ploy and figure out what is omitted and what is real. Think for oneself instead of hoping that the authority would be thinking on your behalf.
