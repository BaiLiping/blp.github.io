I've never really understand why inflation is necessary. The last time I am reading Mankiw's book, it says something like people don't like their wages decreased, that is why it can only increase. Basically, some psychological nonsense. Yet Michael Pettis, again, him, provided a good reason for its existance.

He thinks that there are two kinds of investment, the productive ones, where the cash flow of the future would be able to pay off the debt. The non-productive ones, where there would be no future cash flow from the project and the debt has to be restructured or implicitly inflated away. Inflation is a method for the society to absorb unproductive invement/debt. Since there would always be non-productive investment, there would alaways be implicit absorption of it, i.e. inflaiton.

[Here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/michael-pettis-on-persistent-imbalances-in-post-pandemic-china) is his interview at odd lots, great show by the way.

Inflation, implicit or explicit, is the way to serve unproductive debt. There is always a limit on how much debt an ecnomy can take up, as the debt level changes, the economic agents change their behavior, for instance flight to safety. Also there is an accounting issue in Chinese economy, when you spend money on unproductive project, and does not create value, the correct way to register that money is as expense, but here in China, it is registered as capital. Therefore, the total wealth registered on paper is greater than the real wealth. This scheme can work if the economical growth is greater than the armotization of that capital, and it would stop when the debt increase decelerate. There is not an unlimited amount of capacity for debt, and we don't know where that limit is, that is the issue.

He always have good takes on the Chinese economy, not ideologically driven, balanced. For instance, he mentioned financial repression of Chinese household, which is 50% of the economy while in other economies the proportion is roughly 70-80%. Because of the fixed interest rate stuff, there is an annual transfer of 14% interest rate from household sector to the non-household sector. He also talked about the dynamics of an economy driven by monetary policy, you just have to play the acquiring asset game, since that is how the game is structured. It has nothing todo with personal philosophy, just if you are in the position to have to play the game, that is the only way to do it. That is what he learned from the Latino debt crisis, when he told people to go after fixed interest rate loan, he was laughed at. Also he points out that Chinese measure the GDP as investment rather than production, so it is not comparable to that of the rest of the world.
