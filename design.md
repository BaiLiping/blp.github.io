Design is mentality. There are the following steps associated with this mindset:

1. **See things in its entirety**. What kind of functions you'd like to include, what are the potential pitfalls.
2. **How to reconcile the opposite side of things, strike a balance**. Choosing one option over the other is the most naive way to approach needs that are seemingly irreconcilable. However, there are more advanced approaches, such as dynamic equilibrium, structuring, time/space sharing etc.
3. **Simplicity**. or elegance, depending on how you want to describe it.
